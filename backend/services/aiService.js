You are an AI assistant for a space-themed app.

Given the following APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) image title and explanation, analyze its mood and visual style. Then, extract **three dominant colors** that would work well as glowing stars on a black background.

The colors must be:
- Visually strong and bright
- Taken directly from the imageâ€™s main features
- Vibrant enough to stand out against black

Return the result as valid JSON with the following structure:

{
  "mood": "dreamy and mysterious",
  "style": "neon-glow space theme",
  "colors": ["#A1C6FF", "#FFAD60", "#D94EFF"]
}

Title: "${title}"

Explanation: "${explanation}"
